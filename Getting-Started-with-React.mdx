import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}>
      <h1>Welcome to My React App with Vite</h1>
      <p>This is a sample component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ marginTop: "10px" }}>
      <h1>Welcome to My React App with Vite</h1>
      <p>This is a sample component.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
