We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

```app

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen mt-4">
      <div className="md:flex justify-between items-center bg-muted p-4 rounded-xl border-l-2 border-l-violet-600/80 md:h-32">
        <div className="md:w-1/3">
          <Clock />
        </div>
        <div className="md:w-2/3 mt-2">
          <FunFacts />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-10">
        <div>
          <div>
            <h2 className="text-md font-bold">Technology</h2>
            <p className="text-[13px] text-muted-foreground">
              Current technology stack
            </p>
          </div>
          <TechSlider />
        </div>
      </div>
      {/* @ts-expect-error Server Component */}
      <Posts />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
